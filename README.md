# flutter-meme-maker

A sort of image editor made with flutter that allows for putting images and text on top of eachother.

Not optimized and lacks a lot of features but should be fine for making simple memes.

I tested a bit on OnePlus6 (Android 11) and Linux, seems like it works most of the time. No IOS support and windows not tested.
