# Meme Maker Privacy Policy
This app is not programmed to collect any personally identifiable information. The app uses storage permissions to save images to save images to gallery or share images. 

The app uses network for `load image from url` functionality to work. The endpoint of the url entered by the user might or might not collect any information.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please open an issue on this github repository.
